#Coding part:


The  Python script that performs some operations on Excel files using the pandas library. It reads data from an input Excel file, combines it with an existing Excel file, removes duplicates, creates a pivot table based on specific columns, and saves the modified data and the pivot table to a new Excel file.


1. The `sys.argv` is used to retrieve command-line arguments.
   ```python
   file1, tab1 = sys.argv[1]+".xlsx", sys.argv[1]
   ```

2. The script tries to open a file named `'data.xlsx'` and read data from it, but it's unclear whether this file exists or if it should be created initially. Make sure you have the correct file name and path or create the file manually if it doesn't exist.

3. The code attempts to open the output file using `os.system('start excel data.xlsx')`. This command opens the file using the default program associated with `.xlsx` files on your system. However, this command is specific to Windows and may not work on other operating systems. If you're using a different operating system, you'll need to modify this line to open the file in the appropriate way.

4. Some variables are not defined or assigned values in the provided code snippet. Make sure you have defined and assigned appropriate values to the following variables before running the script:
   - `row_index`
   - `col_Values`
   - `outValues`
   - `openFile`

Make sure to address these issues and provide the necessary values for the variables before running the script.
