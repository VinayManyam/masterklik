The code reads data from two Excel files (file1 and file2) and specific sheets (tab1 and tab2) using the pandas library. It then combines the data from both files into a new DataFrame called df_new.

The code checks the number of rows in df and df1 using the shape attribute and prints the counts. It then concatenates the two DataFrames using the concat() function and sets ignore_index=True to reset the index of the combined DataFrame.

After combining the data, the code removes any duplicate rows using the drop_duplicates() function. It then creates a new Excel file called Res.xlsx using the ExcelWriter class from pandas.

Finally, the code saves the df_new DataFrame to the Excel file with the sheet name "Total" and index=False to exclude the index column from the output. If openFile is set to 1, the code opens the output file after adding the data.

Overall, the code reads data from two Excel files, combines them into a new DataFrame, removes duplicates, and saves the combined data to a new Excel file.
